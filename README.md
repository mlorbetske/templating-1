# Templates

## Getting Started
ASP.NET Templates provide project templates which are used in .NET Core for creating ASP.NET Core applications.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.

## Building from source

Some projects use content generation to produce the template files.
For local development on the templates, execute `dotnet build` on the csproj.
This will execute a target which transforms `.csproj.in` files into `.csproj` files.
